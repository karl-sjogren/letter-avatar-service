# Letter Avatar Service

A microservice that generates image avatars consisting of one or two letters.

## Background palettes

A good palette of background colors is important. There one compiled into the
`DefaultPaletteService` is generated via [i want hue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/)
which is a great little servive that creates great palettes and can generate
as many colors as needed (instead of just a few complementary colors as most
service gives you).

## Notice

While this is a fully working and useful project this is also my playground for new
services and libraries. This is why there are support for a lot of services and multple
CI configured.
